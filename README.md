## 📝 Description

The **Push Swap** project is about sorting a stack of integers using a set of predefined operations with the least number of moves possible. This project allows you to explore and implement various sorting algorithms and optimize their performance, focusing on stack-based data manipulation.

## 🚀 Features

- Implementation of stack-based sorting algorithms.
- Use of a limited set of operations to sort the numbers in ascending order.
- Efficient handling and sorting of small to large sets of integers.
